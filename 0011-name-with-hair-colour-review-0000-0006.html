===================================== 

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, 
 b) documenting program-flows, and
 c) JS syntax.
 
File: 0011-name-with-hair-colour-review-0000-0006.html
Time: 45 minutes allowance

Review file "0000-0006-in-class-exercise-name-with-hair-colour.html" - observe 
how the instructions were copied into the script and reused as comments.

Modify the script to collect one additional data, e.g. the height of the person
and modify the output to include this additional data.


 1. Update this file by adding a HTML comment with your set of instructions and
    items required for this script.
	
 2. Create a flowchart to show the program flow.
 
 3. Create a script element and include your own script. Remember to reuse your 
    instructions as script comments.
    
 4. Upload the completed files to your GitHub repository.
    Ensure that all uploaded file names for this exercise start with '0010-'

<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>Write out a set of instructions to ask a user to input
   their name and hair colour. On successful data entry, the 
   system will produce a 'one sentence' output in following format:
</p>
<p>"(name data) has (hair colour data) hair."<br>
   e.g. Ben has black hair.</p>

<h3>Data Items Required</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users Name</li>
<li>Users Hair Colour</li>
<li>Composed Sentence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instruction Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prompt user to enter user's name.</li>
<li>Prompt user to enter user's hair colour.</li>
<li>Compose sentence by concatenating data with predefined strings ('has' and 'hair.').</li>
<li>Output composed sentence.</li>
</ol>



<script>

// Users Name
var usersName;

//Users Hair Colour
var usersHairCol;

//Users Height-----------------------------------------------------------------
var usersHeight;

// Composed Sentence for Output
var composedSentence;

// Prompt user to enter user's name.
usersName = prompt('Enter your name');

// Prompt user to enter user's hair colour.
usersHairCol = prompt('Enter your hai colour');

//Prompt user to enter user's height.------------------------------------------
usersHeight = prompt('Enter your height in cm');

// Compose sentence by concatenating data with predefined strings ('has' and 'hair.').
// Change sentence to add users height.------------------------------------------
// previous versioin ---   composedSentence = usersName + ' has ' + usersHairCol + ' hair.';----------
composedSentence = usersName + ' has ' + usersHairCol + ' hair and have ' + usersHeight + ' cm of height.';

// Output composed sentence.
console.log(composedSentence);
