=====================================

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, 
 b) documenting program-flows, and
 c) JS syntax.

File: 0013-arrays-of-items-and-item-properties.html
Time: 30 minutes allowance


Reuse your script from the "0012-array-of-items.html" exercise. Create four more
arrays to store some properties of the items that you have listed:
 - create array to store the colours of your items
 - create array to store the weight of your items, e.g. heavy, medium, etc
 - create array to store the size of your items, e.g. big, medium, etc
 - create array to store an additional property of your choice
 
The output of this script is to display an sentence in English stating the name 
and properties of the fourth array elements.


 1. Update this file by adding a HTML comment with your set of instructions and
    items required for this script.
	
 2. Create a script element and include your own script. Remember to reuse your 
    instructions as script comments.
    
 3. Upload the completed files to your GitHub repository.
