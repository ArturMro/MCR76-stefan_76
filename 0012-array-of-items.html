2. exercise for 12th Dec 2019
=====================================

This morning we will practice:
 a) identifying instructions steps, 
 b) documenting program-flows, and
 c) JS syntax.
 
File: 0012-array-of-items.html
Time: 30 minutes allowance



Compose a script that creates an empty array. Continue on adding the names of
items that you find around you as elements (one by one) to this array. Ensure 
to add as many as six items.


 1. Update this file by adding a HTML comment with your set of instructions and
    items required for this script.
	
 2. Create a flowchart to show the program flow.
 
 3. Create a script element and include your own script. Remember to reuse your 
    instructions as script comments.
    
 4. Upload the completed files to your GitHub repository.
    Ensure that all uploaded file names for this exercise start with '0012-'
